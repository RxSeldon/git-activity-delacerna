BSIT-3

  I learned that version control is really important because it helps keep track of changes in a project and
makes it easier to go back to older versions if something goes wrong. Git is the tool we use on our computer
to manage those changes, while GitHub is the website where we can upload and share our code with others.
I also learned some basic Git commands like init, add, commit, push and pull, which are used to save and 
upload updates. A repository is basically the folder where all the project files and versions are stored.
Lastly, I learned how to connect Git to GitHub so I can push my local projects online and start collaborating
with others.
